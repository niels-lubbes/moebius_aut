# Moebius-aut 


## Introduction

Moebius-aut is a Python library for constructing surfaces that with prescribed Moebius automorphisms.
The surfaces that are constructed contain at least two conics through each point.
Algebraically, this library computes quadratic forms in an ideal that are invariant under subgroups
of SL(2)xSL(2) and SL(3).  

This library depends on [SageMath](https://SageMath.org) libraries.

__Example 1: Computing G-invariant quadratic forms in the ideal of the double Segre surface__

We show in this example how to compute quadratic forms in the ideal of the 
double Segre surface that are invariant under the group SL(2)xSL(2).
The double Segre surface (also known as the Veronese-Segre surface) is an embedding of 
P^1xP^1 into projective 8-space P^8. 
We may conclude from the output that  there is a hyperquadric Q in P^8 
of signature (4,5) such that Aut(P^1xP^1)=SL(2)xSL(2) is contained in Aut(Q). 
 
```python
from moebius_aut.class_dsegre import DSegre
from moebius_aut.class_ma_ring import MARing

t, q, s, r, e, T = DSegre.get_gens_sl2() # obtain generators of Lie algebra sl2
c_lst_lst = [t + e, q + e, s + e, e + t, e + q, e + s ] # generators of Lie algebra sl2+sl2
iq_lst = DSegre.get_invariant_qf( c_lst_lst, [] )
print( iq_lst )
print( MARing.get_rand_sigs( iq_lst, 1 ) )
```
Output:
    
    [(-2)*x0^2 + 2*x1*x2 + 2*x3*x4 - x5*x6 - x7*x8]
    [[4, 5]]
    

Below we explain how to represent Lie subalgebra's of the Lie algebra sl2+sl2.
```
If the real structure acts as complex conjugation (involution='identity'), 
then the Lie algebra sl2 is generated by the following 2x2 matrices    

    t = [ 0 1 ]   q = [ 0 0 ]   s = [ 1  0 ]  
        [ 0 0 ]       [ 1 0 ]       [ 0 -1 ]    

We also consider elements in sl2 that generate subalgebra's
    
    e = [ 0 0 ]   r = [ 0 -1 ]
        [ 0 0 ]       [ 1  0 ]

We obtain elements in the direct sum sl2+sl2 via of generators in sl2
    
    t+e = ( [ 0 1 ] , [ 0 0 ] )   t+t = ( [ 0 1 ] , [ 0 1 ] )    
          ( [ 0 0 ]   [ 0 0 ] )         ( [ 0 0 ]   [ 0 0 ] )
    
The direct sum sl2+sl2 is generated by

    [t + e, q + e, s + e, e + t, e + q, e + s ]

The subalgebra so2+so2 is generated by

    [ r+e, e+r ]

The real structure may act different as complex conjugation. 
For example if involution='rotate', then the action on sl2+sl2 is    

    ( [ a b ] , [ e f ] )   |-->    ( [ d c ] , [ h g ] )
    ( [ c d ]   [ g h ] )           ( [ b a ]   [ f e ] )

followed by complex conjugation.
In this case the subalgebra so2+so2 is generated by

    [ S+e, e+S ]    where   S = [ I  0 ]
                                [ 0 -I ]

However, since --- for our purposes --- we consider the matrices up to scalar multiplication, 
we have that the Lie subalgebra so2+so2 is generated by

    [ s+e, e+s ]
```


__Example 2: Computing G-invariant quadratic forms in the ideal of a projection of the double Segre surface__

We show in this example how to compute quadratic forms in the ideal of a linear projection of the 
double Segre surface that are invariant under the group SO(2)xSO(2). Moreover, we assume that 
the real structure is non-trivial (see below for more information).
This example shows that there exists a Del Pezzo surface of degree 6 in the projective 5-sphere S^5 
that is invariant under a 2-dimensional subgroup SO(2)xSO(2) of Aut(S^5).
Notice that S^5 is a quadric of signature (1,5+1). 

```python
from moebius_aut.class_dsegre import DSegre
from moebius_aut.class_ma_ring import MARing
 
t, q, s, r, e, T = DSegre.get_gens_sl2()
exc_idx_lst = [5, 6]  
c_lst_lst = [ s + e, e + s ] # so2+so2
involution = 'rotate'

iq_lst = DSegre.get_invariant_qf( c_lst_lst, exc_idx_lst )
print( iq_lst )
iq_lst = DSegre.change_basis( iq_lst, involution )
print( iq_lst )
sig_lst = MARing.get_rand_sigs( iq_lst, 10 )
print( sig_lst )
```
Output:
    
    [x0^2 - x7*x8, x0^2 - x3*x4, x0^2 - x1*x2] 
    [x0^2 - x7^2 - x8^2, x0^2 - x3^2 - x4^2, x0^2 - x1^2 - x2^2]
    [[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 4]]

Below we explain the "exc_idx_lst" and "involution" parameters.
``` 
We fix the following monomial parametrization of the double Segre surface 

    (s,u) |--> (1:s:s^{-1}:u:u^{-1}:s*u:s^{-1}*u^{-1}:s*u^{-1}:s^{-1}*u)
               =
               (x0:x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8)

We consider the exponents of the monomials as coordinates in a lattice.
Thus, for example, 1=s^0*t^0 corresponds to the coordinate (0,0) which corresponds to x0
and the monomial s*u^{-1} corresponds to the coordinate (1,-1) which corresponds to x7, etc.
We schematically denote this correspondence by the following square:

    [8 3 5]    
    [2 0 1]    
    [6 4 7]

The antiholomorphic involution defined by the real structure acts as unimodular involution
on the square.     

    identity:    ( a, b ) |--> ( a, b)
    leftright:   ( a, b ) |--> (-a, b)
    rotate:      ( a, b ) |--> (-a,-b)  
    diagonal:    ( a, b ) |--> ( b, a)

We obtain a parametrization of a toric projection of the double Segre surface
by omitting monomials from the the above parametrization.

For example we obtain a parametrization of a smooth Del Pezzo surface of degree 6, 
if we compose the parametrization of the double Segre surface with the linear projection 

    (x0:x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8) |--> (x0:x1:x2:x3:x4:x7:x8) 

and if the set the involution to 'rotate'. We schematically denote this as    
    
    -= del Pezzo surface of degree 6 =-
        [* *  ]   
        [* * *]   
        [  * *]
    exc_idx_lst = [5,6]   
    involution='rotate'

Below we give an overview of choices for normal toric surfaces that contain
at least conics through each point

    -= double Segre surface =-
        [* * *]        
        [* * *]        
        [* * *]        
    exc_idx_lst = []
    involution in ['identity', 'rotate', 'leftright']

    -= del Pezzo surface of degree 6 =- 
        [* *  ]   
        [* * *]   
        [  * *]
    exc_idx_lst = [5,6]   
    involution='rotate'

    -= weak del Pezzo surface of degree 6 =-
        [  *  ]   
        [* * *]   
        [* * *]   
    exc_idx_lst = [5,8]   
    involution='leftright'

    -= Veronese surface =-
        [*    ]
        [* *  ]
        [* * *]
    exc_idx_lst = [1,3,5]   
    involution in ['identity','diagonal']
              
    -= ring cyclide =-          
        [  *  ]             
        [* * *]             
        [  *  ] 
    exc_idx_lst = [5,6,7,8]   
    involution='rotate'

    -= horn cyclide =-    
        [  *  ]   
        [* * *]   
        [  *  ]  
    exc_idx_lst = [5,6,7,8]   
    involution='leftright'     
    
    -= spindle cyclide =-
        [  *  ]   
        [  *  ]   
        [* * *]   
    exc_idx_lst = [1,2,5,8]   
    involution='leftright'       
    
    -= 2-sphere =-
        [     ]
        [* *  ]
        [* *  ]
    exc_idx_lst = [1,3,5,7,8]   
    involution='diagonal'       
```


__Example 3: Computing G-invariant quadratic forms in the ideal of the Veronese surface__

This example shows that there exists a quadric of signature (1,5) in the ideal of the Veronese surface, 
such that this quadric is invariant under the group SO(3). 
Moreover, we show that there exists no quadric that is invariant under the full automorphism group SL(3) 
of the Veronese surface.

```python
from moebius_aut.class_ma_ring import MARing
from moebius_aut.class_veronese import Veronese

so3_lst = Veronese.get_c_lst_lst_dct()['SO3(R)']
iq_lst = Veronese.get_invariant_qf( so3_lst )
print( iq_lst )
print( MARing.get_rand_sigs( iq_lst, 1 ) )

sl3_lst = Veronese.get_c_lst_lst_dct()['SL3(C)']
print( Veronese.get_invariant_qf( sl3_lst ) )
```
Output: 

    [x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 - x0*x4 - x0*x5 - x4*x5]
    [[1, 5]]    
    []
